Voila notre premiere poste du blogue!

I will now desist with the French. Desol√©.

Hacksmiths now has a blog! We're hosted on Github Pages, and Jekyll is our blogging platform of choice. This makes for super-easy blog post submission. We're calling on you, members of Hacksmiths, to write blog posts about your latest hacks, community events you've attended, hardware or software that you love, open source projects you have started or contributed to, even art projects you're working on that involve technology in some way or other.

To submit a blog post:
```javascript
step[0] = "I hope you all went to the git workshop! If not, check out try.github.io, that'll set you right.";
step[1] = "Write your blog post! Markdown formats it easily, and you'll have to write the Jekyll header. Check out other blog posts in the repo to see how that's done - it's very straightforward indeed";
step[2] = "Submit a pull request containing your blog post";
step[3] = "Wait for an admin to approve your post, and it'll appear on the site! But keep an eye on your pull request - if there's a problem with it we'll let you know in the pull request discussion thread on Github, and you can submit again when the issue is resolved.";
```

We're looking forward to seeing your posts!

Make sure to keep an eye on our mailing list, follow us on Twitter, and join our group on Facebook to keep up to date on the activities we're planning in weeks to come.
